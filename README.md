# Project Name
### Skill Based Assessment #2 --- 'JavaScript Fundamentals'
- - - -

## Project Description
### Given a skeleton code consisting of CourseInfo, AssignmentGroup, and AssignmentInfo objects alongside the LearnerSubmission array. Create a getLearnerData() function such that it accepts CourseInfo, AssignmentGroup, and LearnerSubmission (order-sensitive) as parameters. Expected results would be an array of objects displaying each student's unique id number, average score in test #1, average score in test #2, as well as the cumulative average of all of the student's tests.

## Technologies used
### JavaScript concepts:
  *  Conditional Statements
    -  if, else if, else
  *  Loops
    -  for(), while(), .forEach()
  *  Loop Controls
    - break
  *  Error Handling
    - try-catch statements, finally{}
  *  JavaScript Collections
    -  arrays[], objects{}
  *  JavaScript Methods
    -  .push(), .unshift(), .splice(), .forEach(), .includes() ...
    -  Number(), Date(), .getTime()
  *  Functions()
  *  Variables
    - let, const
  *  Other Data Types
    - string, number, boolean, object, ...
  *  Operators
    - Arithmetic: +, -, /, ++ (increment)
    - Comparison: !=, == (loose[value]), === (strict[type & value])
    - Logical: ||
    - Assignment: =, +=
    - String: ``, '', "" 
  
  * Others: Github add, commits; JavaScript syntax, VSCode debugger

## How to get started
### Think of the process and logic involved in achieving the end results. Draft up some pseudo-code on paper. Run through the code line by line, think about the logic.

### Array.prototype.splice() -- this changes the array shallow copy, no need for re-assignment

### 'Implemented variables declaration using 'let' or 'const', operators to manipulate the data (arithmetic, string, etc.), different data types (string, numbers, Boolean) being cached to variables. In addition utilize 2 if-else statements or one switch statement, try-catch statements for error handling, 2 different types of loops, a loop control keyword ('break', 'continue'). Simultaneously, create and traverse JavaScript containers -- arrays using the bracket notation or objects via dot notation. Show how to access the array and object containers. Apply JavaScript array and object methods in appropriate circumstances. Generate functions for repetitive tasks. (Aside: Objects are unordered collection of properties)'
